The following instructions are for Ubuntu.

  * Extract the package to a directory on your development web server. This 
    directory will be referred to as {APP_PATH} in the instructions below.
    
  * Modify the provided {APP_PATH}/app/configs/chargify.ini.dist configuration 
    file to suit your needs. Rename it to chargify.ini
    
  * For Zferral integration, modify the provided 
    {APP_PATH}/app/configs/zferral.ini.dist configuration file to suit your 
    needs. Rename it to zferral.ini
    
  * Add write permissions to the tmp folder. PHP errors, Webhooks and Postbacks 
    will be logged here.
    
    chmod 777 {APP_PATH}/tmp
    
    You are only doing this on a private development server, right??
  
  * Modify the provided apache-vhost to suit your needs and install.
  
    cd /etc/apache2/sites-available
    nano chargify.dev (paste in your modified apache-vhost)
    a2ensite chargify.dev
  
  * Restart apache:
  
    /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
  
  * Modify your hosts file (you are doing this on a development machine right?)
  
    nano /etc/hosts
    type the following on a new line:
    127.0.0.1 chargify.dev
    
  * Browse to your new site. If you used the default vhost, open 
    http://chargify.dev in your web browser.
    
  * Extract {APP_PATH}/www/docs.tar.gz to view DocBlox API doucmentation.
